        <p>
          Congratulations on completing a revolutionary tooth whitening
          procedure! The next 48 hours are important in enhancing and maximizing
          your whitening results for a long lasting, bright and healthy smile.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Spotting</p>

        <p>
          Color Spotting on the teeth may occur after in office Whitening due to
          temporary dehydration of the teeth. This should diminish within a few
          days after treatment. The whitening process will continue for 48 hours
          after treatment.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Sensitivity</p>
        <p>
          During the first 24 hours after whitening treatment, some patients can
          experience some tooth sensitivity or pain. This is normal and is
          usually mild, but it can be worse in susceptible individuals.
          Normally, tooth sensitivity or pain following a treatment subsides
          within 24 hours, but in rare cases can persist for longer periods of
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may wish to take an over-the-counter pain reliever (one you would
          use for a headache). Some patients experience sensitivity such as
          “zingers” or thermal sensitivity 12 to 24 hours after whitening.Taking
          ibuprofen and rinsing with a fluoride rinse will be beneficial.
        </p>

        <p>
          Brushing your teeth with sensitive toothpaste, such as Sensodyne, or
          Fluoride Sensitivity Relief toothpaste for the weeks following the
          procedure is strongly recommended. Now that your teeth are
          significantly whiter, there are a few guidelines to help maintain the
          look of your new smile. The teeth have a protective protein layer
          called the pellicle. This layer contains the surface dental stains and
          is removed during whitening treatments. It takes 24-48 hours for the
          barrier to fully develop again.
        </p>
        <p className="color-cta">Colored food and beverages</p>
        <p>
          For the next 48 hours post treatment, we recommend avoiding dark
          staining substances, such as: Red wine, Cola, Coffee and tea Berries
          such as cherries, blueberries, strawberries, dark grapes Tobacco
          products Red sauces, mustard or ketchup, soy sauce, salsa and other
          red sauces If it will stain your clothes, it will eventually stain
          your teeth
        </p>

        <p>
          If your daily homecare involves the use of PerioRx or any
          Chlorhexidine, please wait 48 hours before continuing the usage of
          this product.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additional ways to maintain your smile: Avoid staining related habits.
          Use an automated toothbrush like OralB. Regular professional dental
          hygiene care to maintain oral health, keep staining to a minimum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use whitening trays for touch-ups as recommended by our dentists.
          Practice good oral hygiene by tooth brushing, flossing, and tongue
          cleaning. We will assist you in selecting the products to maintain not
          only a white smile, but a healthy one as well!
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Take home Whitening Trays for touch-ups</p>
        <p>
          3 days after Treatment, if your teeth are not too sensitive, try
          bleaching a few more times with the take home products during the
          first three to five days after your office visit to maximize your
          results and attain the whitest shade possible. Store any remaining
          whitening gel in a cool dry place for later use.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please make sure the custom tray is completely dry. Place a small
          amount of gel on each of the teeth in the custom tray. Use caution not
          to overload the tray. Insert the tray over the teeth and gently wipe
          away any excess gel. Do not leave any gel on the gums because this
          will cause irritation to your gums.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wear the bleaching trays with the gel as directed in the office. Use
          all the bleaching gel given. This could last from a few days to a
          week. If sensitivity is uncomfortable, stop and reduce time and/or
          frequency of treatment. If too uncomfortable, stop all together.

    content: (
      <>
        <p className="color-cta">Numbness</p>

        <p>
          Your mouth may be numb for several hours after the procedure. Do not
          bite, scratch, or injure the cheek, lips, or tongue during this time.
          You can carefully drink little sips of water during this time but
          avoid eating.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Gum Soreness</p>
        <p>
          Tenderness/Soreness in the gums where shots were injected or around
          the teeth that got fillings is expected and can last for a few days.
          You can take some over the counter pain medicine as needed.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Tooth pain/sensitivity</p>

        <p>
          It is normal to experience some tenderness and sensitivity to heat,
          cold, sweets and pressure after fillings especially if the cavity was
          fairly deep. The sensitivity may last from several weeks to several
          months. Teeth with deep cavities occasionally can become tender, even
          though they were not symptomatic before the filling and a root canal
          treatment may be needed if symptoms do not resolve.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Bite adjustment</p>

        <p>
          We will try our best to make sure your bite is even when you leave.
          However, occasionally the bite may need to be adjusted further. If you
          feel your bite is not even or it hurts to chew, call us immediately so
          we can schedule you for bite adjustment. This is a common reason why
          teeth become tender after fillings.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Diet</p>

        <p>
          You can eat on the side of the fillings once the anesthesia wears off.
          If you had fillings done on front teeth in high stress area (edge of
          the front teeth), avoid biting into anything with firm consistency as
          this will increase the chance of filling failure. An occlusal guard is
          strongly recommended to improve life of these fillings if you grind or
          clench your teeth.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Hygiene</p>

        <p>
          Proper hygiene is critical for the longevity of fillings. Make sure to
          brush and floss as advised to prevent damage to these fillings.
        </p>

        <p>Please call our office with any questions or concerns.</p>

        <p>
          Please read the following instructions carefully for proper post
          operative care after root canal treatment.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Numbness</p>

        <p>
          Your mouth may be numb for several hours after the procedure. Do not
          bite, scratch, or injure the cheek, lips, or tongue during this time.
          You can carefully drink little sips of water during this time but
          avoid eating.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Pain</p>

        <p>
          The goal of root canal treatment is to relieve your pain and in most
          cases the pain will be relieved almost immediately. But, some pain
          from the root canal tooth is expected which is especially true if you
          had a symptomatic infection in the tooth before treatment. There may
          be some tenderness on chewing as well. However, if painful, usually
          you should see improvement within 24-48 hours and should gradually
          improve over the next few days.
        </p>

        <p>
          In most cases, Over-the-Counter pain medication will suffice.
          Prescription medication including Antibiotics may be prescribed and
          should be taken as directed. Occasionally, the pain may last up to 2
          weeks or more but you should still see improvement every day.
        </p>

        <p>
          If your symptoms have not improved at all after a week, please call
          our office immediately. If antibiotics are prescribed, continue to
          take them for the indicated length of time, even if all symptoms and
          signs of infection are gone. Some mild face swelling adjacent to the
          tooth may occasionally happen and should subside in 48-72 hours.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Gum and Jaw Soreness</p>

        <p>
          Tenderness/Soreness in the gums where shots were injected or around
          the tooth that got the root canal where the rubber dam clamp was
          placed, is expected and can last for a few days. And you may also feel
          some tenderness in your jaw from keeping it open for an extended
          period of time. Please take some over the counter pain medicine as
          needed. However, in most cases, the soreness is mild. If your symptoms
          persist more than a week, please call us immediately.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Temporary Filling/ Temporary Crown</p>

        <p>
          Following treatment, we will place a temporary or a permanent filling
          or a crown on your tooth. Between appointments, it is common (and not
          a problem) for a small portion of your temporary filling or crown to
          wear away or break off. If the entire filling falls out, or if a
          temporary crown comes off, please call our office so it can be
          replaced. To protect the tooth and help keep your temporary in place:
          avoid chewing sticky foods (especially gum). Also, avoid biting hard
          foods and hard substances, such as ice, fingernails and pencils. If
          possible, chew only on the opposite side of your mouth.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Final Crown</p>

        <p>
          Usually, the last step after root canal treatment is the placement of
          a crown on the tooth. A crown covers and protects the tooth from
          breaking in the future. Unless otherwise noted by the dentist, it is
          critical to have a crown placed on your root canal treated tooth as
          soon as possible. Because, delay in obtaining final restoration
          (crown) may result in fracture and/or possible loss of the tooth.
        </p>

        <p>
          If your bite feels uneven, you have persistent pain, swelling or
          allergic reaction to medication including rash, hives or itching or
          you have any other questions or concerns, please call our dental
          office.

        <p>
          Follow these instructions for proper care following your dental
          surgery / tooth extraction. Your mouth may be numb approximately for
          several hours after the procedure. Do not bite, scratch, or injure the
          cheek, lips, or tongue during this time. And carefully drink little
          sips of water during this time but avoid eating.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Bleeding</p>
        <p>
          After extraction, a gauze is placed at the site of surgery for you to
          bite on for 30-45 minutes. Replace this gauze as it becomes saturated
          and keep biting for another 30 minutes. This in most cases will be
          enough to stop bleeding. For the remainder of the day, you may notice
          minor oozing of blood, which is normal. If you feel persistent oozing
          of blood, bite on the extra gauze for another 30 minutes. Please do
          not sleep with the gauze in your mouth. If you notice excessive
          bleeding or bleeding hasn’t stopped in 6-12 hours, please call our
          office immediately.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Surgical Site Care</p>
        <p>
          Avoid touching the surgical site for first 24 hours. And do not
          stretch the lips or cheeks to look at the area. Do not rinse
          vigorously, use mouthwash, or probe the area with fingers, tongue or
          other objects. Furthermore, after 24 hours, you may rinse with warm
          salt water or regular tap water after meals or use mouth wash if
          advised/prescribed.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Sutures</p>

        <p>
          In case sutures (stitches) were placed to help control bleeding and
          promote healing, these sutures will either dissolve in 5-10 days or
          will need to be removed. Please call the office for your particular
          situation.
        </p>

        <div className="color-cta">Bone Graft</div>
        <p>
          If a bone graft was placed, a barrier membrane and non-dissolvable
          sutures will be placed. The barrier membrane and sutures sometimes may
          need to be removed in 2-3 weeks. Also, you may feel little chips of
          extra bone graft in your mouth and barrier membrane may feel like a
          jelly-like substance sticking up from the extraction site for a few
          days. Hence, avoid exploring this area with your tongue.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Daily Activities</p>

        <p>
          No physical exercise and exertion for 24-48 hours. Return to normal
          activities as tolerated. Do not smoke for the first 48-72 hours as it
          may cause complications like dry socket and infection and failure of
          implant/bone graft.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Diet</p>

        <p>
          Wait until all numbness is worn off. Do not suck through a straw as it
          will promote bleeding. Stay on a soft, non-chewy diet for the first
          2-3 days and then slowly move to solid foods based on what your mouth
          can tolerate. Moreover, avoid alcohol, carbonated drinks, extremely
          hot or cold beverages for 48 hours. And crunchy, hard, chunky foods
          that can get lodged in the extraction sites.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Oral Hygiene</p>
        <p>
          Keeping the mouth clean is essential. Today, other teeth may be
          brushed and flossed gently, but avoid stimulating the surgical
          site.Avoid brushing sutures if placed. Soreness and swelling may not
          permit vigorous brushing of all areas, but make every effort to clean
          the teeth within the bounds of comfort as poor oral hygiene may delay
          healing and cause complications.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Rinsing your mouth</p>
        <p>
          You should avoid rinsing your mouth for the first day. Though you can
          rinse from next morning with either plain water or salt water or an
          alcohol free mouthwash. If a mouthwash was prescribed to you, use it
          as directed. Warm salt water rinses 3-4 times a day after 24 hours of
          procedure will help soothe the discomfort. Moreover, do not spit for
          48 hours after surgery.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Pain</p>
        <p>
          Completely normal to have pain after extraction, which is expected and
          can last from 2-7 days, depending on the procedure. Unless you are
          prescribed otherwise, you can take Advil or Tylenol or any pain
          medicine of your preference as needed, following directions on the
          label. Alternate between Tylenol extra strength (1000 mg) and Advil
          OTC 2-4 tablets (400-800 mg) every 4-6 hours for severe pain.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Swelling</p>

        <p>
          Slight swelling, inflammation and bruising may occur in the area of
          surgery . In this case, ice packs may be used for the first 24 hours
          (20 minutes on then 20 minutes off) to decrease swelling and/or
          bruising. If swelling persists after 24 hours, use warm/moist
          compresses (20 minutes on then 20 minutes off). Please call our office
          if swelling has not improved after 48 hours.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Limited opening</p>
        <p>
          You may experience jaw muscle stiffness and limited mouth opening
          after extraction and surgery. It may take several weeks to improve.
          Stiffness may be improved by using warm moistened towels on your face
          24 hours after the procedure.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Fever</p>

        <p>
          After the surgery, you may experience slight elevation of temperature
          for the first 24-48 hours . Please drink plenty of fluids and call the
          office if there is a concern.
        </p>

        <p className="color-cta">Dry Socket</p>

        <p>
          Dry socket may result from premature dissolving or loss of a blood
          clot following removal of a permanent tooth. This typically occurs on
          the third to fifth day after the extraction, with a persistent
          throbbing pain in the jaw. Call our office if this occurs.
        </p>

                You may expect some gum soreness around the teeth after crown
                and bridge preparation. Warm salt water rinses will help to
                alleviate discomfort. Injection sites may be sore for several
                days after the appointment. You can take over the counter pain
                medicines or use topical Orajel for temporary pain relief.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Sensitive tooth</p>
              <p>
                It is normal to experience some sensitivity to heat, cold,
                sweets and pressure after your appointment. This sensitivity may
                last from several weeks to several months after treatment.
                Usually, the deeper the cavity, the more sensitive the tooth
                will be. Make sure your bite feels even.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Temporary Crown/Bridge</p>
              <p>
                After your first appointment for crown and bridge treatment, we
                place a temporary crown or bridge on the tooth or teeth
                involved. The temporary crown protects while the custom crown is
                being crafted from sensitivity and helps to prevent movement of
                adjacent and opposing teeth, so the final crown can fit
                properly. Crown is cemented with temporary cement, so it can be
                easily removed at your next appointment.
              </p>

              <p>
                Please avoid hard and sticky foods on the side of the temporary
                teeth to avoid pulling them off. If possible, chew on the
                opposite side from the tooth that was worked on to avoid
                dislodging the temporary. You can brush around your temporary
                teeth gently. You may not be able to floss if the temporary
                teeth are connected together but you can floss between the
                temporary and adjacent natural teeth. Pull out the floss to the
                side rather than up or down from the tooth.
              </p>

              <p>
                If your temporary crown comes off before your next appointment,

              <p>
                We try our best to make the temporary teeth as comfortable and
                esthetic for you as possible, however they may not feel as
                smooth as your natural teeth or permanent crown and the shape
                may not be as accurate. Your permanent crown or bridge will look
                and feel very close to your natural teeth.

                it a quick adjustment to the restoration. Do not assume your
                bite will get better after time. The tooth may become irritated
                and a toothache may occur if this adjustment is not done where
                necessary. It may also cause an increase in temperature
                sensitivity with the tooth.

              <p>
                If anesthesia was used, your mouth may be numb for several hours
                after the procedure. Do not bite, scratch, or injure the cheek,
                lips, or tongue during this time. You can carefully drink little
                sips of water during this time but avoid eating.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Diet</p>

              <p>
                Do not eat or drink for 1 hour after crown/bridge seat. Skip
                eating on the side of crown/bridge seat for your next meal.
                After that, you should be able to eat or drink like normal.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Gum irritation</p>

              <p>
                Your gums might stay irritated for a day or two due to cement
                clean up or if gum tissue was manipulated.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Hygiene</p>
              <p>
                It is extremely important to maintain proper hygiene to ensure
                your crown/bridge lasts you a long time. Please brush and floss
                around crowns as normal. For Bridge, use floss threaders and
                waterpik to clean food trapped under the bridge, at least once
                per day.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Tooth Sensitivity</p>

              <p>
                If your teeth have not had root canals done, your teeth may
                become sensitive after crown/bridge seat. In most cases it is
                temporary and should only last a few days. Occasionally teeth
                may need root canal treatment after crown/bridge placement due
                to permanent nerve irritation
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Bite adjustment</p>

                We will try our best to make sure your bite is even when you
                leave. However, occasionally the bite may need to be adjusted
                further. If you feel your bite is not even or it hurts to chew,
                call us immediately so we can schedule you for bite adjustment.

                Congratulations on your new dentures. We are excited about a
                better smile and function as you use your dentures. Please
                review the following instructions:
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">New Appliance</p>

              <p>
                If this is your first denture, your mouth may take some time to
                adjust to the presence of an appliance. Eventually, your tongue
                and cheek tissues will get used to the presence of the dentures
                in your mouth.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Replacement Dentures</p>

              <p>
                If you had dentures before and are getting them replaced, the
                new dentures may feel different fit, polish, shape and texture.
                Because it is impossible to make the dentures exactly similar to
                your previous dentures.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Speech</p>

              <p>
                Speech may be affected for a few days but as you wear your
                dentures, it returns to normal.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Denture soreness</p>

              <p>
                As you adjust into your new denture, you may notice some areas
                of soreness. If soreness doesn’t resolve in 2 days, your denture
                may need adjustments. Moreover, most dentures will need multiple
                adjustments before fully comfortable. Please call our office if
                a sore spot has lasted more than 2 days.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Bite adjustment</p>

                We will try our best to make sure your bite is even when you
                leave. However, occasionally you may need a bite adjustment. If
                you feel your bite is not even or it hurts to chew, call us
                immediately so we can schedule you for bite adjustment.

                Importance of Improved home dental care
              </p>

              <p>
                For partial dentures, it is extremely important to maintain
                great home dental hygiene to avoid cavities on the teeth that
                support your partials. Food typically gets trapped under
                partials and can cause cavities on adjacent teeth. After every
                meal, remove your partials and rinse your mouth and denture. If
                possible, brush your teeth. At night, take your partials out and
                follow a meticulous home care routine to ensure no food residue
                remains on your teeth.
              </p>

              <p>Please call our office with any questions or concerns.</p>

              <p className="color-cta">Pain and Swelling</p>
              <p>
                Please leave the immediate dentures in place for 24 hours after
                your teeth have been removed. Because the dentures will act as a
                bandage to protect the extraction sites and to prevent swelling.
                Also, the dentures will limit the bleeding and swelling with
                their splinting. Place ice packs on the face in the extraction
                areas for 20 minute intervals will help minimize the pain. And
                please follow pain medication instructions as per the doctor’s
                prescription.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Rinsing</p>
              <p>
                DO NOT RINSE YOUR MOUTH in the first 24 hours, as this may
                dislodge the clots in the tooth socket. As a result, you may
                develop a dry socket, which can be very painful. This rarely
                happens but when it does, it is usually the result of smoking.
                If you feel the need to remove the dentures, remember to rinse
                them quickly with cold water and reinsert immediately. If you
                cannot insert the denture, wait for your dentist to help you. We
                recommend that you place a towel on your pillow, because it is
                normal to have some oozing of blood.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Diet</p>
              <p>
                In the first 24 hours, your diet should consist of non-
                carbonated, cold beverages (i.e. ice tea) and soft foods.
                Progress diet as healing allows.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Denture and Mouth Care</p>

              <p>
                AFTER INITIAL 24 HOURS, Use a denture brush that is contoured to
                clean your denture and an ADA approved denture- cleaning
                solution. Clean dentures twice a day. When the denture is out of
                your mouth, place in water to prevent the acrylic from drying
                out. Do not wear your denture at night, because exposure to
                oxygen is best for your gums.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Bite</p>

              <p>
                In the first 24 hours, the dentures may not feel right.
                Moreover, you may also experience salivation and gagging for the
                first few days. We will adjust your denture over the next couple
                of appointments. Please be patient as you heal. The doctor and
                his staff will help you adjust to your new prosthesis.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Healing</p>

              <p>
                Over the next 3-4 months, you will have many changes in your
                mouth. Remember the removal of teeth involves bones and bone
                requires 3 months to completely heal, (like hip surgery). You
                can purchase denture adhesive at the drug store (any kind will
                work), which will help hold the denture in place while you heal.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Chewing</p>
              <p>
                Please chew your food on both sides of your mouth with your
                dentures. And you will learn to master this quickly if you like
                to eat. There are four major muscles and several minor muscles
                associated with chewing and they will adapt over time to your
                prosthesis.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Speech</p>

              <p>
                You may notice a lisp or slurring of your speech in the first
                days of wearing your denture. Which is normal and will disappear
                as you adjust to your denture.
              </p>

              <p className="color-cta">Esthetics</p>

              <p>
                For many people, a denture is replacing stained or diseased
                teeth. The denture will not only help you feel healthier but
                will help you look better.
              </p>

              <p>
                REMEMBER– Your tongue and your cheeks hold the lower denture in
                place. Some patients can master this technique quickly and for
                others it takes some time. You will never have complete seating
                of the lower denture because there is no possibility of
                “suction” like that obtained in the upper denture. For some
                patients with a large amount of bone loss, a small amount of
                adhesive will always be necessary.

          After gum therapy, in typically 2 weeks, once the gums heal, you can
          expect to notice less redness, less bleeding and less swelling of your
          gum tissue. Your mouth will taste, smell and feel better. Your gum
          health can then be maintained with proper homecare and regular
          professional care. However, you should expect the following right
          after your procedure:
        </p>
        <p className="color-cta">Numbness</p>
        <p>
          If we used anesthesia, you will experience numbness in your mouth for
          several hours after the procedure. Do not bite, scratch, or injure the
          cheek, lips, or tongue during this time. You can carefully drink
          little sips of water during this time but avoid eating.
        </p>
        <p className="color-cta">Discomfort</p>
        <p>
          Although, you may experience some pain and discomfort, it should
          subside within a few days.
        </p>
        <p className="color-cta">Tooth Sensitivity</p>
        <p>
          It is common to have teeth sensitivity to hot, cold and/or sweets.
          Even if you notice the temperature sensitivity for the first several
          days, it usually diminishes over time. We may recommend application of
          a desensitizing fluoride. You can use over the counter sensitivity
          toothpaste as well.
        </p>
        <p className="color-cta">Bleeding</p>
        <p>
          Brushing and flossing may cause some bleeding, but the bleeding should
          steadily decrease as your gums heal over next week or so.
        </p>
        <p className="color-cta">Appearance</p>
        <p>
          As the gums heal they may change their shape around the teeth. This is
          normal as the gum tissues heal and shrink. However this may expose
          spaces between the teeth that were previously covered with tartar
          build up or swollen gums. This may cause spaces to show between the
          front teeth or you may notice more food impaction between the front
          teeth.
        </p>
        <p className="color-cta">Diet/Eating</p>
        <p>
          Chewing hard foods, such as meat or raw vegetables may be
          uncomfortable if extensive root planing was performed; this should
          last no longer than a few days. A diet of a softer consistency would
          be advised until chewing becomes more comfortable.
        </p>
        <p className="color-cta">Pain</p>
        <p>
          In most cases the discomfort will be minor. However should you feel
          the need, take any over the counter pain medicine, as needed.
        </p>
        <p className="color-cta">Oral Hygiene</p>
        <p>
          If gum tissues are tender, brush your teeth gently but thoroughly;
          this may take a little more time than normal. Mouth rinsing is
          recommended with either of the following solutions: 1) an
          anti-microbial rinse. 2) A warm salt-water rinse. Use of either of
          these rinses should be limited to one to two consecutive weeks.
