        <p>
          Gums bleed when they are irritated and inflamed which is not
          considered normal. This is due to plaque (a soft film of bacteria)
          being left on the teeth which causes inflammation called gingivitis
          and if not addressed can develop into gum disease. Over time, if not
          cleaned off through daily brushing and interdental cleaning, the
          plaque can turn into a hard deposit called tartar or calculus which
          will require professional scaling by your dentist or hygienist to
          remove it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important even if your gums bleed they are still brushed to keep
          the mouth clean otherwise the bacteria build up in the mouth will make
          gum inflammation worse. After a few days of thorough cleaning, your
          gums should stop bleeding. If this does not happen you will need to
          ask the advice of your dental team as you may need professional
          cleaning.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          A good oral care regime should be able to prevent your gums from
          bleeding if done correctly. We would always suggest that you have
          regular examinations at your dentist. This can help diagnose and treat
          anything unusual in your mouth so you get the correct care and advice.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may have to use a softer brush whilst the gums are inflamed until
          they become healthier. It is also important to clean in between teeth
          daily using interdental brushes or floss.

          &nbsp;can&nbsp;cover up a&nbsp;gum problem as it restricts the blood
          flow to the mouth. If you have recently given up smoking this could
          allow the gums to get a better circulation and therefore start to
          bleed.

        <p>
          You can try using a toothpaste specifically designed for sensitive
          teeth. Rub a little toothpaste into the sensitive area when going to
          bed as it helps protect the surface.
        </p>

        <p>
          Try to avoid strongly acidic foods and drinks and wait at least an
          hour after eating before brushing as this could cause even more
          sensitivity. Grinding your teeth can also increase sensitivity and a
          mouth guard maybe necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the pain continues, speak to your dental team and they may be able
          to offer further care to reduce your symptoms. A number of things can
          cause sensitivity and your dental team will be able to identify these
          and advise the correct care.

        <p>
          Generally any discomfort after an extraction does not last for long
          and can easily be controlled by the painkillers you would normally
          take for a headache. If it lasts any longer than 24 hours you should
          go back to your dental team for advice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes pain may occur 3-4 days after the extraction when a blood
          clot has not formed properly in the extraction socket and the bone
          becomes infected. You will need to go back to your dentist, who will
          dress the socket for you.

          If you have facial swelling which developed suddenly this could
          indicate that you have an infection. You will need to see a dentist as
          you may need some antibiotics to relieve the symptoms of this
          infection.

        <p>
          At your initial visit, your new dentist will take all of your personal
          details, such as your address and date of birth. They will also take a
          full medical history to make sure that they are fully aware of any
          illnesses or medication that you may be taking and they can then treat
          you safely.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dentist will then carry out a full check-up and chart all of your
          teeth and previous treatment, they will also assess the condition of
          your gums and your general oral hygiene. They may also take diagnostic
          x-rays.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you need to have any dental treatment, your dentist will discuss
          this with you. They may give you a treatment plan and tell you what
          the cost is going to be.
        </p>
        <p>You can make any further appointments as necessary.</p>

        <p>
          Before planning on a trip abroad or native country for dental
          treatment there are a number of factors to consider.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is important to do your research and familiarize yourself with the
          process in the country you are looking at having the treatment, as
          well as speaking about it with your dentist here first. The things you
          need to think about are:

          content={"Possible Complications"}
        ></AccordionParagraph>

        <p>
          Many people who are going abroad are wanting more advanced (higher
          cost) procedures which are more likely to result in complications. No
          matter how skilled the clinician, there is always a risk of treatment
          failure. If complications do arise once you are home, it will not
          always be easy to return to the clinic which provided the treatment,
          especially if there is an infection. Your insurance may not cover the
          travel costs involved in returning to the clinic.

          content={"Fine-adjustments"}
        ></AccordionParagraph>
        <p>
          Procedures such as crowns, bridges, veneers and implants are not
          easily carried out rapidly. Expertise and time are essential to
          achieving a good outcome. For instance, to achieve a perfect bite, the
          patient can require repeat visits and a series of adjustments. This
          may not be possible if the dentist is abroad.

        <AccordionParagraph
          className="color-cta"
          content={"Language barriers"}
        ></AccordionParagraph>

        <p>
          It is always important that your clinician can communicate with you
          and explain the treatment provided and recommendations for
          post-surgical care. This is always more difficult when English is not
          the first language of your practitioner. He or she needs to know
          exactly what you want and you need to know exactly what you are
          getting. Problems and complaints often arise from communication
          issues.

        <p>
          Different countries have a different concept of aesthetic beauty. For
          example, in some countries very white and even teeth are thought
          attractive, whereas in others a more natural smile is preferred. There
          are also varying clinical standards. Our dentists are more likely to
          save a tooth, discuss with you all the treatment options available to
          you and help you make an informed decision. Not all countries have the
          same high standards of cross-infection control, and in developing
          countries there can be a higher incidence of infectious diseases.

          Many of those considering travelling abroad believe that private
          dentistry in USA is not affordable. However, sometimes this is based
          on an assumption. It is advisable to talk to our expert team check
          prices and get familiar with our payment plans. This can help spread
          treatment costs, making treatment both affordable and accessible.

          Here at Phoenix Dental we know how busy life can be. Fitting a dental
          appointment into your busy schedule seems to be one of the most
          difficult things you have to do. Proper oral hygiene can be difficult
          to maintain. Brushing for two minutes twice a day and flossing after
          every meal will keep many oral hygiene problems away, but not all.
          Scheduling a cleaning twice a year is highly recommended to maintain
          proper oral hygiene and catch problems before they become costly and
          painful.

          Not only can we identify problems before they become painful and
          expensive, but we can also help to keep your smile looking fabulous.
